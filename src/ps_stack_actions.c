/**
 * # Updates Push Swap Stack values after a Transfer
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Ensures that the `bigger` (maximum) and `smaller` (minimum) values of two
 * stacks remain correct after a push operation where only `other_stack` receives
 * a new top node from `self`.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## How it works:
 *
 * 1. Retrieves the top content of `other_stack`
 * (the stack that received the node).
 *
 * 2. Checks if the transferred value was previously the maximum or minimum
 *    of `self`. If so, recalculates `self->bigger` or `self->smaller` by
 *    traversing the stack with `find_ps_bigger_node` or `find_ps_smaller_node`.
 *
 * 3. Updates `other_stack->bigger` and `other_stack->smaller` if the new
 *    top element introduces a new maximum or minimum.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## In summary:
 *
 * Keeps both stacks' metadata consistent after a push operation, ensuring
 * accurate tracking of maximum and minimum values even when transferred
 * elements were previously the extremes.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * @param self        The stack from which the node was transferred. Its
 *                    extremes may be recalculated if the transferred node
 *                    was previously its `bigger` or `smaller`.
 * @param other_stack The stack that received the node. Its extremes are
 *                    updated if the new top element changes them.
 *
 * @return This function does not return a value.

/**
 * # Retrieves the Typed Content of a Push Swap Node
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Provides access to the content stored in a `t_stack_node`, ensuring
 * it is returned as the correct type (`t_ps_node_content`).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## Why this function exists:
 *
 * - In a generic stack implementation, each node stores its data as a
 *   `void *` (generic pointer).
 * - While this allows flexibility, it requires explicit casting back
 *   to the correct type before use.
 * - This function centralizes and standardizes that casting, making the
 *   code cleaner and safer to maintain.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## How it works:
 *
 * 1. Takes a pointer to a `t_stack_node`.
 *
 * 2. Accesses the generic `content` field of the node.
 *
 * 3. Casts it into the specific type used in `push_swap`: `t_ps_node_content`.
 *
 * 4. Returns the correctly typed pointer.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## Benefits:
 *
 * - Removes repetitive casting throughout the codebase.
 * - Improves readability by making the programmerâ€™s intent explicit.
 * - Reduces the chance of type-related mistakes when accessing node content.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * @param node  The stack node whose content will be accessed.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * @return A pointer to the `t_ps_node_content` stored in the given node.

/**
 * # Finds the Largest Node in a Push Swap Stack
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Traverses a `t_ps_stack` to find and return the node with the largest
 * integer value (`bigger`).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## How it works:
 *
 * 1. Initializes two pointers: one starting from the top of the stack,
 *    the other from the bottom.
 * 2. Compares the values at both ends against the current `bigger` node.
 * 3. If a larger value is found, updates `bigger` to point to that node.
 * 4. Moves the `top` pointer down (via `prev`) and the `bottom` pointer
 *    up (via `next`) simultaneously.
 * 5. Repeats this process until all elements are checked.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## Why both directions?
 *
 * - The function iterates from both ends at once (`top` and `bottom`),
 *   effectively halving the number of iterations needed compared to
 *   a single-direction traversal.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## In summary:
 *
 * Efficiently scans a stack from both ends to determine the node with
 * the maximum `value`, returning a pointer to that node.
